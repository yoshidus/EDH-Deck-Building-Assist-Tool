# EDH-Deck-Building-Assist-Tool

You know these concepts I will detail below, but the better engrained they are the better your EDH play experience will be. EDH games can take awhile and may get a bit grindy at times. If you get more familiar with the following info, you'll be able to watch youtube vids in between turns.

Boardstates

Large stalemates lasting several turns are no more. There's plenty of access to cards that destroy all creatures or make creatures unblockable, and effects that mess with players without attacking. EDH decks are built in a way to always have access to resources in hand and graveyard, so if all your permaments are removed you won't be relying on the top of the deck. Also, many players run as many search effects as possible, so a nuclear bomb card or combo piece is not far away.

Fast Mana

Here are the most notorious fast mana artifacts. Any of these played in the first couple of turns is a huge advantage, especially sol ring- whose controller deserves a kick in the balls. There are effective ways of keeping up with a player who runs off with one of these without having to play one yourself.

Mana Fixing

Since EDH decks contain singles, there will be several multicolored mana sources that work differently. Take a moment to get familiar:

Signet

Pay 1 mana and tap this to get 2 mana back. So basically when counting mana, this counts a one mana. I always advise when allocating mana for plays to use these first since it's less flexible.

Filter Land

Like the Signet, but also helps fix color weight.

"Bounce" Land

Don't get these mixed up with other multicolored lands due the the silimar looking card frame. See at the bottom that you tap it for 2 mana. The drawback is when it's played you have to return another land to your hand. *Use your mana first before playing this land. So it's 2 land drops in one card. If someone blows it up it's a bad time. For that reason I rarely run these.

Various Conditional Lands

Once again the card borders are basically the same. Eventually players tell these lands apart by either the expansion symbols or memorizing the names. These are lands with different mechanics that determine if they come into play tapped or not. Not the end of the world if they come in tapped. If you need untapped lands real bad, shell out extra $$ for the following types of lands.

Lands with Basic Land Types

These are lands that aren't one of the five basic lands but still count as a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest- or better yet a combination of them. You might recall the original duals from back in the day. Wizards has since printed two other cycles of lands with basic land types.

"Fetch" Lands

These find lands of a basic land type- the land itself need not be basic. In a deckwith 3 or more colors with a full compliment of dual lands, any fetch land will give access to any of the decks colors, into play untapped.

Really slow lands

These lands can produce mana of any color, but you have to pay 1 mana when that land first comes into play.

Command Tower

This land only functions in an EDH game. In terms of access to colors, this is the always the best land in the deck. Typically an auto-include

Nuclear Warfare

Here are a few of the most notorious game warping cards. Take notice a common trait is that they warp the game as soon as they are played/come into play. The mana you spend to kill a Vorinclex will not be available to you the following turn.

Oops I just won't the game

Many players make sure to include an infinite combo in their EDH decks. The following cards are almost always used as a combo piece:

"Voltron" Commander Strategy

This refers to decks that play it's commander and pile a ton of buffs on it. It's guaranteed the commander will attack for at least 14 damage and will be untargetable and unblockable.
